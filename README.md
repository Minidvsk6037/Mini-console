# Hi my name is Mini I have been working on this code for 2 months and most of that was at school for those who want answers to their question “Without questions there are no answers. And without answers no truth, no progress, no future.” ― Victor Canning, The Crimson Chalice I think you for deciding to use the mini console, I will miss working on this but summer is over school is back and I have to get back to learning C# and make other codes to help people and for people enjoyment. Bye <3 <3 <3
